        <h3>The body consists of the content of your website</h3>

        <h3>HyperLinks</h3>
        <p>Hyperlinks are like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20hyperlink%2C%20or,Hypertext%20is%20text%20with%20hyperlinks. target="_blank" title="Wikipedia:Hyperlink">this</a></p>
        <p>It uses (a)(/a). Inside (a) it needs a hyper text reference (href)</p>
        <p>Like (a href="https://www.google.com") <a href="https://www.google.com">Click Here</a> (/a)</p>
        <p>You may add target="_blank inside (a) to open the hyperlink in a newtab and title="text" to show a tooltip on hovering on said tip</p>
        <p>In Example it should look like this 
            <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" title="Goes to google">Click here!</a>
        </p>
        <img src="images/Screenshot_23.png">
        <p>you can also redirect to another 
            <a href="2.html" > HTML File</a> 
        </p>



        <h1>How to import images to your website</h1>
        <p>This part is all about (img) where you can use images and gifs to be used in your website</p>
        <p>src is short for source, this is where you put the source of the picture. Either a file director or a url</p>
    
        <img src="images/website.png" alt="pictue of a website" title="source is in file directory">
        <br>
    
        <img src="images/website2.png" alt="picture of a image" title="source is in google images">

        <p>img also has attributes such as alt, which shows a text when the src is unavailable, title, where it shows a tooltip when hovered, and img can also be used as a hyperlink.</p>
        <p>img can also be edited using width and height to customize size of an img</p>
        <img src="images/attribforimg.png" alt="attributes for img">
        <h4>Here's an GIF of a cat breakdancing</h4>
        <img src="images/cat-breakdancing.gif" alt="cat-breakdancing" title="cat-breakdancing">


        <h1>Audio Files</h1>
        <p>This part teaches you how to put audio in your website</p>
        <p>Here's an example of a mp3 audio.. HEADPHONE WARNING</p>

        <audio controls>
            <source src="audio/Metal pipe falling sound effect but its more violent.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            <source src="audio/Metal pipe falling sound effect but its more violent.wav" type="audio/wav">
        </audio>

        <p>Unlike img, audio cannot use irl to be used as an src only fire directory. </p>
        <p>Putting controls in audio makes it show a simple control. you may add attributes like autoplay, loop and muted which are self explanatory </p>
        <img src="images/audio.png" alt="example of audio" title="audio in coding">


        <h1>Video Files</h1>
        <p>Now we continue by adding video files in your website</p>
        <p>video is really similar to audio in terms to coding</p>
        <p>here's an example.</p>

        <video controls width="1000" height="600" autoplay muted>
            <source src="video/DARK SOULS™ REMASTERED_2023.06.24-20.16.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="video/DARK SOULS™ REMASTERED_2023.06.24-20.16.ogg" type="video/ogg">

        </video>

        <p>video can also be customized using width and height. And attributes like autoplay, loop, and muted can also be applied here</p>
        <img src="images/video.png" alt="video in code" title="code:video">


        <h1>Both audio and video can use a back up incase .mp3 and .mp4 are not working or not supported by a certain browser. <br> This can be fixed
            by using a different video file like .wav or .ogg and telling the program what type it is.
        </h1>
        <img src="images/audiotype.png" alt="back up for audio" title="backup for audio">
        <img src="images/videotype.png" alt="back up for video" title="backup for video">

    

        <h1>Favicons</h1>
        <p>Favicons are icons that appears next to your website's title thus normally
            it is put in the Head section.
        </p>
        <p>Note that the minimum size for a favcon is 96 by 96  pixels and their extensions could be 
            <br> .ico, .png, .gif, .jpeg, .svg.

        <h1>Div and Span</h1>
        <p>Div and span are commonly known as grouping tags for styling using CSS.</p>
        <p>Div takes a whole block while span is inline which makes it simillar to (mark) in highlight text</p>
        
        <h1><span style="background-color: pink;"> This is a span </span></h1>
        
        <div style="background-color: aqua;">
            <h1>This is a div</h1>
        </div>

        <p>As you can see, span only takes the text while div extends and takes a whole block.</p>

        <img src="images/tableex.png" alt="example of a table" title="excel table">
        <br>
        <p>To create a table like that example we first need to create a Table then a Table Header (th)</p>

        <img src="images/th.png" alt="table header" title="table header">
        <br>
        <p> Then create another Table then a Table Data (td). th and td must be in equal numbers for equality purposes</p>

        <h1>Buttons</h1>
        <p> Buttons (button) are exactly what they sound like, it's a button that can be clicked. This is what they look like</p>

        <h1> Headers, Main, Footers</h1>
        <p> Headers, main, and footers are ways to organize your code</p>
        <p> In simplicity it's basically the introduction, body, and conclusion when writing a paper</p>
        <p> Header is what is presented at your top page</p>
        <p> Main is the main content of your websites </p>
        <p> Footer is the bottom of your page </p>
        <p> These three make it easier to manage and customize when you come to learn about CSS and JavaScript</p>

        <header>

        </header>

        <main>

        </main>

        <footer>

        </footer>

        <img src="images/foot.png" title="foot">
